= Using Git =

== Getting this repository to your own folder ==

In bash, perform the following scripts in the folder for which the game project should be pulled into.  The '$' sign 
simply means whatever the terminal says, you only type what is after that mark.

* $ mkdir 'racing-asu'
* $ cd 'racing-asu'
* $ git init
* $ git add remote origin git@github.com:travis134/racing-asu.git
* Note: If you are using a branch, change the location of the repository to its corresponding link on github.
* $ git pull origin master

Don't forget that once you've got your git directory set up, you only have to use the last command inside the directory to get any changes that have been made by others.

== Using git to push to the repository ==

In git there are 3 steps to pushing your changes to the repository.

* Adding files to be commited (sometimes you don't want to upload all of your changes, this allows for cherrypicking).
* Commiting files (this locally saves changes, and creates a message to let others know what you did)
* Pushing files to the repository (this saves all your local commits to the repository, allowing others to access your contributions.

How to push:

* $ git add -A
* Note: -A will save ALL of your changes, including deleted directories, new files, etc.  If you want to manually select items, simply leave off the -A and put in files' paths.
* $ git commit -m 'This is a commit message'
* Note: Don't forget to change the commit message to something that tells what you did.
* $ git push origin master
